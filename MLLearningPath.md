# Ability to Program using R or Python
  For simplicity, we'll go forward with Python

  This section has 3 parts:
    1. The basics - Mandatory
    2. What you will be doing most of the time when you're working in the real world - Can be deferred
    3. Essentials if you want a job and excel at it - Can be deferred

  - Basics of Python:
    - Data structures
    - Control flow
    - Looping
    - Modules and packages
    - Functions
    - Error handling
    - Objects

  - Real world skills
    - File based operations
    - Connecting to databases
    - Consuming APIs
    - Writing good code
    Recommended resource: Head First Python, Fluent Python, Real Python Site

  - Fluency and Logical Thinking
    - Ability to reason about problems and provide solutions to them in an efficient manner
    - Ability to write good maintainable code

    To become fluent in Python and get good at solving problems using the language, practice some competitive programming. Learn the basics of data structures and algorithms. While this is not essential for machine learning itself, interviews usually start off with this. No company wants to hire a person who can't think logically and analytically.
    
    Recommended Resources:
    	- Basics of data structures and algorithms: Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
	- Competitive programming: Hackerrank (Solve problems from the problem solving section and place below 10K), Leetcode


# Math
Ok. This is where things start to get real. This is the part where you start learning about how things work internally. Machine learning is essentially a bunch of calculus, probability theory and linear algebra mixed together. So, you'll need all three to become a good machine learning engineer. While all the things in this section can seem tough and complicated, you will need to understand only the basics to get started.
 
## Calculus
    - Functions
    - Differential Calculus
    - Integral Calculus

## Probability and Statistics
    - Probability
    - Probability distributions
    - Statistics
        - Basics
	- Standard Deviation and what it means in real life?

## Linear Algebra
    - Matrices and matrix manipulation


# Machine Learning - Theory
Take Andrew Ng's course on coursera to get a gist of all the basics. The labs are optional. But, try to complete the entire course to get a good understanding of all the algorithms out there.

If after attending some interviews, you're asked questions on these algorithms themselves, then you can learn more about the basic algorithms here:
    - Introduction to Statistical Learning (Basics)
    - Elements of Statistical Learning (Super advanced and completely math filled) (Most of the time, you won't be needing this)

# Python for Machine Learning
In the real world, most of your time will be spent working with data. Gathering data, cleaning it, munging it, validating it and moving it to the proper platform so that it can be used for modelling will be what 90% of your time is going to go into.

To do this, 99.9% of the times, you will use some libraries.

## Basics
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scikitlearn - for basic modelling

There's a brilliant book Jake Vanderplaas titled Python for data science. This book starts off by explaining all the things required to understand everything about the aforementioned libraries. The title is Python for Data Science.

## Advanced
Most machine learning these days uses deep learning. So, while learning traditional machine learning techniques is good and it's required for the basics, the real focus should be on understanding the cutting edge technologies out there. The best place to learn about this is fast.ai

fast.ai has a course which teaches everything there is to know about deep learning and provides a good starting point from which you can continue you study. So, take the course. The website is https://www.fast.ai

If you want to learn more about how deep learning works internally, then I recommend http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

As for libraries, you can either learn PyTorch or TensorFlow. However, I recommend PyTorch because it's flexible relative to TF. The choice is yours though.


# Skills Companies Expect You To Have
    If you're aiming to work as a ML engineer, then these are the basics most companies will expect you to have. This is split into two sections: Must Haves and Nice to Haves

## Must Haves
    1. SQL Knowledge: You need to learn SQL. Why? Because you'll be working with data, and data is generally stored in SQL databases.
    2. Communication: The ability to take complex ideas and communicate it effectively to management in business terms will set you apart from engineers who are only good at technical stuff.
    3. Research: Most of your time will be spent identifying the algorithms which can solve the problem you have at hand. Ability to sift through the internet, find the relevant research paper see if it fits your use case is an important skill to have.
    4. Rapid Prototyping: If you're working in a fast paced environment, the better you are at learning things quickly and pushing out implementations that work, the more you will thrive.

## Nice to Haves
    1. NoSQL Knowledge: Images, audio and other stuff used in deep learning are stored in NoSQL databases. While this is not super important to know, it's good if you have a rough idea about how these systems work.

There are tons of other things which will go here. But, for a beginner, that's overkill.

# Projects
By the time you start applying for real, you should have 1-2 projects you can talk about in your interviews. This is super important. Try to think of something which you find fun, formulate the problem and solve it using machine learning. If you can't seem to think of anything, talk to people  and ask them for ideas which you can use for your projects.

Don't just get stuff off the internet and flaunt it as your own. The interview will know.

# How Should You Go About Learning This

Here's a sample learning path you can take:

    1. Finish the basics of Python

    2. Finish Python for Machine Learning - Basics

    3. Start Andrew Ng's course.
        3.1. As you're going through the course, start working on your resume. (Trust me, this is the ideal time to do it).

    4. After finishing Andrew Ng's course, start the fast.ai course.
	4.1. This course has about 20 videos in total and is split into two parts.
	4.2. Watch one video a week. This course will take about 20 weeks (5 months). Make sure to understand the implementation and theory behind each video properly.
		When I say properly, you should be able to explain that video in 5-10 minutes to a 3rd grader and make them understand it.
	4.3. If you're feeling dangerous, watch two videos a week. Still, make sure you understand it properly.
	4.4. Focus on completing Part I first. Part II is something you can continue to do even after you land a job.

    5. After you finish part 1 of the fast.ai course, start working on your real world Python skills. Learn to work with files, databases, and get data from sites like twitter/facebook/instagram using their APIs (read about this).

    6. Interviews -> Testing the water:
    	6.1. By this point, you should have enough knowledge to crack most basics interviews.
	6.2. So, take a week to work on your resume. Make it as perfect as possible. Start applying. 
	6.3. This is just a testing phase. Attend the interviews, but don't expect to land the job.
	6.4. Your aim here is to understand what the industry expects from you.
	6.5. If you fail your interviews, use it as a feedback mechanism and alter you learning path accordingly.
	6.6. If you get a job/internship which you want to take up, forge ahead. Just make sure you work on the other items parallely.

    7. After you start applying, practice competitive programming.
	7.1. Create an account with Hackerrank. You will start at a rank >= 6 lakhs.
	7.2. Start solving the problems in their 'Problem Solving' section.
	7.3. Get your rank down to <= 15K.

    8. Simultaneously, start working on the stuff in the Skills Companies Expect You To Have - Must Haves section. This will give you an edge over other people. You don't need to spend a lot of time here. But, get a good understanding of the fundamentals. Google is you friend.

    9. Projects: Ref. the projects section

    10. Start applying for real.
    	10.1. At this point, it's been quite sometime since you started on this journey. You've learned enough. It's time to start applying.
	10.2. Pick and choose your jobs. Specifically, pick jobs which give you a good base. Check the reputation of the company.
	10.3. As a rule of thumb, pick jobs which match your skill level. But, don't be intimidated by jobs which seem to be tough. Most of them are not.
	10.4. If there's a job whose description contains a lot of words you don't know about, but you like the company, apply! You can always learn new stuff. Being passionate about the product is more important than having all the skills.
	10.5. Track your success rate with the jobs. Learning from your failures is vital here!
    11. You've landed your job! Omedetou!
    12. Pass on this knowledge and help someone else get into this wonderful field!


# Timeline
Here's the timeline for the sample path described above

NOTE: THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE. YOU MIGHT TAKE LONGER OR LESSER TIME! DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH. MAKE YOUR OWN LEARNING PATH, SET A TIMELINE AND STICK TO IT!

1. Finish the basics of Python - 2 weeks
2. Finish Python for Machine Learning - 10 days
3. Andrew Ng's course - 1 week
4. fast.ai course - Part 1 - 8 weeks
5. Real World Python Skills - 2 weeks
6. Interviews - Testing the water: No definitive timeline. This can go on as long as you want it too. I attended 2 interviews before I decided to stop. I bombed both of them kek.
7. Data Structures, Algorithms and Competitive Programming - 4 weeks
8. Skills Companies Expect You To Have - Must Haves section - You just need to know the fundamentals. I'd say spend about 20-30 hours on each item. How you manage the time is upto you.
9. Projects - This can take as long as you want it to.
10. Interviews - Will go on until you land a job which you like
