A machine learning learning path

# Disclaimer
This is something I used when I first learned ML back in 2018. Although some things might have changed, I believe most of it is still relevant today. That's because, this path only focuses on the basics and nothing else.

If you find anything is outdated, or wrong, please feel free to correct me. If you think it's good and can help someone, please share!

And, if you have your own learning path, put it up somewhere for the world to see.

Arigatou!
